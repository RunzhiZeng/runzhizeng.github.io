I am a second-year phd student at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Jiaxin Pan](https://sites.google.com/view/jiaxinpan). My research focuses on the design and analysis of post-quantum secure cryptosystems.


<!--
* Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE), including
  * Tight security of AKE protocols
  * Password-based AKE protocols
* Lattice-based Cryptography, including
  * design of efficient lattice-based cryptosystem, and
  * security analysis in quantum idealized models, e.g., quantum random oracle model and quantum ideal cipher model.-->
