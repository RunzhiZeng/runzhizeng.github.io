My research focuses on post-quantum cryptography, with particular emphasis on secure handshakes and the transition of cryptographic protocols to post-quantum settings. I am especially interested in connecting formal security models with practical protocol design and deployment considerations.

I am currently a post-doc researcher at [Universität Kassel](https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/), working with [Jiaxin Pan](https://sites.google.com/view/jiaxinpan). I completed my PhD in September 2024 at [Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet](https://www.ntnu.no/) under the supervision of [Jiaxin Pan](https://sites.google.com/view/jiaxinpan), with [Tibor Jager](https://itsc.uni-wuppertal.de/de/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-ing-tibor-jager/) as the co-examiner.
