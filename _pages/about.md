I am a second-year phd student at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Jiaxin Pan](https://sites.google.com/view/jiaxinpan). My research interest is in the area of public-key cryptography, with emphasis on the following topics:

* Design and analysis of authenticated key exchange (AKE) and password-based AKE

* Constructing efficient lattice-based cryptosystems

* Analysis of post-quantum cryptosystems in quantum idealized models
