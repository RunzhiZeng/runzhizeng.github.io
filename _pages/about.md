I am currently a post-doc researcher at [Universität Kassel](https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/) working with [Jiaxin Pan](https://sites.google.com/view/jiaxinpan). In September 2024, I completed my PhD at [Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet](https://www.ntnu.no/) under the supervision of [Jiaxin Pan](https://sites.google.com/view/jiaxinpan), with [Tibor Jager](https://itsc.uni-wuppertal.de/de/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-ing-tibor-jager/) as the co-examiner. My research interest is in the area of public-key cryptography, with emphasis on the following topics:

* Design and analysis of authenticated key exchange (AKE) and password-based AKE

* Construction of efficient lattice-based cryptographic schemes

* Security analysis of post-quantum cryptosystems in quantum idealized models
